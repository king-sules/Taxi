An analysis of taxi popularity in NYC after tlc new policy implemented in August 2018

In August 2018 the taxi & limousine commision passed a new policy which restricted the rides given to for hire vehicles,
such as Uber and Lyft. This was to allow the yellow cab to compete with these rising companies

Through this project, we analysed how many rides taxi cabs give out every day, and month. We then compare this to rides that fhv
vehicles give out. We use Postgres SQL to essentially gather our information.

We use python to visualize our results. Afterwards, we use facebooks fbprophet to predict the future trends in rides given in both
fhv and taxi. 





RESULTS:

The rides given with taxis are significantly less than for hire vehicles. Furthermore we see a decreasing trend in rides given
in taxi in 2019 with the opposite trend for fhv, so it seems that tlc policy did little to no impact on the riders opinion on 
taking a taxi vs.fhv
